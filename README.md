## 🎯 About Me

I am a passionate **AI/ML Engineer and Technical Author** based in **Ruiru, Kenya**, with a deep focus on turning cutting-edge AI research into reliable, scalable, and production-ready systems.

Over the past years I have built and documented complete end-to-end blueprints that real engineering teams actually use:

- Full **LLMOps pipelines** that go from prompt to production monitoring
- **Federated Learning** architectures that respect privacy and data sovereignty
- Deep technical breakdowns of the evolution from RNNs → Transformers
- Practical **AI Infrastructure & Compute Optimization** strategies
- The shifting role of technical writers in the age of AI co-authors

All my guides are **open-source, battle-tested in structure**, and written from the perspective of someone who has to ship AI systems that don’t break at 3 a.m.

I created this central portfolio so recruiters, engineers, and fellow AI practitioners can discover everything I’ve built in one place.
